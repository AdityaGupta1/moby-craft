This project is a Minecraft client-side mod to manage and visualize Docker containers in Minecraft. It is based off of Minecraft Forge, and is made for the latest version of Minecraft 1.8. Complete instructions as to how to install this mod are coming soon.

This project aims to:

. Make a visual representation of Docker containers in Minecraft
. Allow the user to manage those containers in Minecraft
. Integrate Docker commands into the game

== Features of the project

. New commands that bring Docker commands into Minecraft (see <<commands_list>>)
. Containers made of Minecraft blocks that can be started and stopped at the literal press of a button (see <<outside_container>> and <<inside_container>>)
. Moby the 3D Minecraft whale mascot!
