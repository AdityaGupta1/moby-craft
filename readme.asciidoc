This project is a Minecraft client-side mod to manage and visualize Docker containers in Minecraft. It is based off of Minecraft Forge, and is made for the latest version of Minecraft 1.8. Complete instructions as to how to install this mod are coming soon.

This project aims to:

. Make a visual representation of Docker containers in Minecraft
. Allow the user to manage those containers in Minecraft
. Integrate Docker commands into the game

Features of the project:

. Command to list containers in chat (/docker ps)
. Commands to create, kill, and restart containers (/docker create, kill, kill_all, restart)
. Command to build containers (/docker build_containers)
. Physical containers that can be started and stopped at the literal press of a button (see <<outside_container>> and <<inside_container>>)
. Moby the 3D Minecraft whale mascot!

The outside of a Minecraft Docker container can be seen in <<outside_container>>.
